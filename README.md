# looking-for-group-server

It's becomingly increasing difficult to meet people nowadays. Looking for group helps you find groups of new people around your area scheduling events and activities! Begin with logging in and verifying with Facebook. Select from a list of categories such as lunch, games, and food. See the number of people attending local events and the recommended age range. Signing up for events is anonymous until a defined time before the event is reached. An event finalizes once a certain time before the event is reached and the minimum number of people is met. You will be able to view the location of the event, to enter a group chat with the other participants, and to view others' ratings and reviews once the event becomes finalized. If the specified minimum number of people isn't reached before the event becomes finalized, the event gets cancelled. After successful events, give reviews and ratings for other users.
